Coming soon (or not so soon) ...

A command line program to do the things the books on unsafe rust say
not to do, like dereference null pointers amd stuff.

Also inspired by [fail](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/fail), but intended more as 
code to look at for educational purposes -- don't run this on any computer you care about.
